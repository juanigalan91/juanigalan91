## Frontend Software Engineer

### A little bit about me
I am a Software Engineer with a focus on frontend applications, which has been my focus over the last 7 years! I am very passionate when it comes to creating web applications and APIs that take into consideration the experience of each stakeholder, mainly developers and end users ðŸ™‚

I strongly believe that the best user experiences are supported by a developer experience that allows us to focus on the task at hand, and in the meantime, pay close attention to several key aspects, such as performance ðŸš€, testing âœ…, maintainabilityðŸ“š and readability ðŸ‘“ of the project, and allowing the project to grow and evolve in a sustainable manner.

Currently, I am working at [LumApps](www.lumapps.com) as a Frontend Software Engineer, using technologies such as React, Typescript, Node JS, Redux, Webpack and Sass. As for the backend, we work with several frameworks such as Go, Python and Node JS, developing applications that support a microservices architecture hosted on Google Cloud. 

We also have a strong focus on performance, using the several techniques such as Lazy Loading, code splitting and API optimizations to provide our users with the best and fastest experience they can have!
