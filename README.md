## Frontend Software Engineer

### A little bit about me
I am a Software Engineer with a focus on frontend applications, which has been my focus over the last 7 years! I am very passionate when it comes to creating web applications and APIs that take into consideration the experience of each stakeholder, mainly developers and end users ðŸ™‚

I strongly believe that the best user experiences are supported by a developer experience that allows us to focus on the task at hand, and in the meantime, pay close attention to several key aspects, such as performance ðŸš€, testing âœ…, maintainabilityðŸ“š and readability ðŸ‘“ of the project, and allowing the project to grow and evolve in a sustainable manner.

Currently I am working for LumApps's Frontend Core Team, working on our product's main architecture on the frontend side, and creating a development environment for the entire development team. We create and provide tools that enhance the developer experience and increase our product's quality and lead the migration of the entire product from Angular JS to React as well as maintaining Core functionalities such as the Main navigation of the site, translations, routing, customizations, etc. We work using technologies such as React.js, Redux, TypeScript, SCSS, Webpack on the frontend side, with backend applications in Go, Python and Node js.

Responsibilities:
- Design and Development of our frontend applications
- Responsible for designing the solution as well as performing code reviews, use of best
practices, performance analysis, repository management, and task distribution.
- Overview and analysis of applications after deployment
- Metrics analysis such as performance, loading times in order to detect problems, and possible enhancements

### Personal projects
#### Monorepolyser
This open source project is a Github Action that allows monorepo to retrieve statistics from how dependencies are used and trigger actions from those statistics. For example, if a package is used by multiple packages, we can consider it as a Core package and trigger specific CI checks if those packages are changed.

You can check it out [here](https://github.com/juanigalan91/monorepolyser)

#### Covid Uruguay
The COVID-19 pandemic obviously had an impact on all countries, but living abroad, away from your country during a moment of crisis can be tough. For me, I wanted to at least do something to help out in any way I can. That is why I created a website (using TS, React and Netflify) that grouped all the different donations that could be made during the pandemic in Uruguay in order to provide more visibility to those in need.
